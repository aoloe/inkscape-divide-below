# inkscape-divide-below


inkscape extension to devide the current path from all paths below it.

## Notes

- This is not an Inkscape extension (yet). Just a bunch (even small...) of notes about an Extension.
- Scripts are in `/usr/share/inkscape/extensions`
- `coloreffect.py` shows how to get the selected and all the elements
